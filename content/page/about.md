I'm a Scala software engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in computer vision and AI. Over the years, I've worked with various programming languages like PHP, Java, Haskell, Python, and Scala, which has become my favorite. My professional journey has allowed me to tackle diverse projects, developing web applications, and building backend systems. However, Scala's functional paradigm and expressive syntax have captivated me the most, enabling me to write elegant, scalable, and maintainable code.

Beyond coding, I love engaging with the tech community through open-source contributions and meetups. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, reading, and engaging in creative DIY projects. Through this blog, I aspire to share my experiences, insights, and discoveries, delving into Scala, backend development, AI, and other intriguing topics. Let's embark on this journey together, learning and growing in the ever-evolving world of technology!
